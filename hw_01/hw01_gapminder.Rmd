**Exploratory analyses of the Gapminder base**  
First and foremost I need to load the tidyverse pacakge and the gapminder base  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
```
After examining the base, I am interested in exploring if there is a relationship between the GDP per Capita and the life expectancy of a person
```{r}
plot(gapminder$gdpPercap,gapminder$lifeExp)
cor.test(gapminder$gdpPercap,gapminder$lifeExp)
```
plot reveals a positive relation between the two variables that is confirmed with a pearson's correlation test (t=29.65, p< 0.01) the correlation coefficient is 0.58 meaning a positive, relatively strong relation.
