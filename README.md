## About this repository and myself
**Hello! this Olivia's repository for homework one**  

**_About me_**  
![](http://williamslabubc.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/1/0/17102980/published/olivia.jpeg?1504668424)  
I am a new Ph.D. student at the Geography department at UBC, IÂ´ll develop comprehensive models on spread of invasive plants that take into account landscape structure, population dynamics and biotic interactions.  
These are some of my hobbies:  

* Hanging out with my wife and dogs    
* Boardgames  
* cycling   
* Scuba Diving  
* Reading:
    * Post 90's fiction
    * graphic novels
    * japanese contemporary literature
    * Y.A. (I know but I need a break after all those papers)  
    
**Process Report**  
  I was succesful on modifying the README file from Rstudio and then commiting and pushing it to the repo that I created for the homework. At first I was unsure if I had to create a readme file in my Rproject, but then I remembered one was made when I first created the repo, and I just opened that in R studio once the repo was pulled.   
I had no problems posting an image or making bold or italic sentences, for the bullets I had to dig in forums a bit, because round bullets didn't apperar if I didn't add a line before the bullet. I couldn't manage to display emojis  
At some point there was a merge conflict but I was able to resolve it (I don't exactly know how)
